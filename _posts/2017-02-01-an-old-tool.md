5 years ago, I decided to learn D3.js. I was a designer, and didn't have much JavaScript experience. Looking back, it was one of the best career decisions I've made.

I've used many different design tools. Some have been helpful, many are obsolete.
Data visualization has lasting power. It's an old tool.

Data visualization is challenging because it sits at the intersection of many disciplines. Graphic design is one of these, but so is behavioral psychology, statistics, and mathematics. The reason it's challenging is also a reason it's worth digging into. You get exposure.

I still consider myself a designer, but data visualization is an important creative and technical outlet of mine.
