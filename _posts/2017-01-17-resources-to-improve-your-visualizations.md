I’ve collected some of my favorite resources that you can use in combination with D3.js to enhance your visualizations and save you time.

</a>
[D3 Legend](http://d3-legend.susielu.com/) created by [Susie Lu](https://twitter.com/DataToViz) is a nice way to generate legends. If you are sick of building legends over and over again, this is a great resource.

[Graph Scroll](http://1wheel.github.io/graph-scroll/) created by [Adam Pearce](https://twitter.com/adamrpearce) makes it easier to build scrolling visualizations like [this one](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-auto-sales/) on Bloomberg.

<br>
[Textures.js]() created by [Riccardo Scalco](https://twitter.com/eidogram) is awesome for a host of reasons. There’s a large variety of textures, a nice API, and also good ideas for how to use them in your visualizations.

</a>
<br>
[D3.tip](https://github.com/Caged/d3-tip) created by [Justin Palmer](https://twitter.com/caged) is one of the first D3 plugins I used. You can use this on all sorts of visualizations to provide context and additional information.

[D3 Line Chunked](http://peterbeshai.com/vis/d3-line-chunked/) created by [Peter Beshai](https://twitter.com/pbesh) is a great way to display missing data for your line charts.
